# DijkstraRouteFinder
A route planner implemented with an Arduino client and Python server that uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a map of Edmonton.

To run the server and client make the Arduino C files and then make sure you start the python server (on your computer) before you run the client code on the Arduino
