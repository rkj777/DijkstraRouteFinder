"""
Graph module for directed graph. Helper function provided by professor

Includes the functions implemented in the Jan 21/22
lectures with one key difference.

The way the nodes and edges are stored has already
been converted to the "adjacency list" representation
we will discuss next lecture.

More specifically, _alist is a dictionary that maps
a node u to the list of neighbours of u. You can call
the methods of the graph in exactly the same way as before,
these changes simply improve the running time.

All running time statements are under the assumption that it takes
O(1) time to index a dictionary.
